### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Since graceful degradation allows us to "fall back" to a degraded version of our website while maintaining the original performance, we believe that graceful degradation and service workers are related in the sense that service workers permit our website to keep running even without an internet connection. So, instead of simply having our website crash when the internet is gone, service workers allow us to "degrade" gracefully to an offline version of our website once the connection is gone. 
Therefore, having service workers on your website is a way to have some graceful degradation in your website.
